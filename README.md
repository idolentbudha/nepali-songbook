# Digital SongBook App (Phase 1 MVP)

A simple, cross-platform mobile application built with **Expo and React Native** to help musicians quickly access and organize song lyrics with chords.

## 🌟 Phase 1 Core Features (MVP)

The primary goal of this initial phase is to establish the core song display and personal organization features:

1.  **Song List:** A complete, scrollable list of all songs in the library.
2.  **Filter by Artist:** Easily filter the main list to show songs only by a selected artist.
3.  **Chord Display:** Display chords clearly formatted **above** the corresponding lyrics for easy reading while playing.
4.  **Favorites Section:** Users can mark songs as favorites for quick access in a dedicated, separate view.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

You must have **Node.js**, **npm/yarn**, and the **Expo CLI** installed on your machine.

````bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

# # Welcome to your Expo app 👋

# This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

# ## Get started

# 1. Install dependencies

#    ```bash
#    npm install
#    ```

# 2. Start the app

#    ```bash
#    npx expo start
#    ```

# In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

# - [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
# - [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
# - [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
# - [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

# You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

# ## Get a fresh project

# When you're ready, run:

# ```bash
# npm run reset-project
# ```

# This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
